# How to make the ***Perfect*** Sandwich

#### This tutorial will tell you every step to take in order to build the ***perfect*** sandwich, whether for yourself, or to share with someone else!

## 1. Choosing the right bread

#### Choose bread that goes with the type of sandwich you are making.

*Example*: Don't choose a Rye bread with caraway seeds in it if you are putting sweet elements on your sandwich, such as peanut butter and jelly.

- What kind of bread might we choose to go with a ***Ham*** and ***Swiss*** sandwich?

    - [x] Rye Bread
    - [x] Cheese & Chili Ciabatta
    - [x] Sourdough Bread
    - [ ] Cinnamon Raisin Bread

*Note: The cinnamon raisin bread might be great with something sweet, like Peanut Butter & Jelly, or Nutella*.

> "At home, when you make a sandwich, you reach below the first two pieces of bread to get the really good bread. It's sort of a survival thing. Let my family have the rotten bread. I'll take care of numero uno."
-George Carlin

## 2. Choosing the right combination to go inside your sandwich

#### Choose items that pair together to make the perfect sandwich.

### ***Here are some classic combinations***:

- *Cold Sandwiches*:

    - Turkey and Cheddar
    - Ham and Swiss
    - Roast Beef and Pepper Jack
    - Tomato, Mozzarella, and Basil
    - Chicken Salad
    - Egg Salad
    - Italian Sub

- *Hot Sandwiches*:
    - Philly Cheesesteak
    - Grilled Cheese
    - Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato
    - Cuban Sandwich
    - Meatball Sub

## 3. Deciding whether it's going to be a *hot* or *cold* sandwich

#### Almost any sandwich can be hot or cold, so how do you know when to heat it up?

- If you are planning to put fresh ingredients like lettuce and tomato on your sandwich you should leave the sandwich cold, or wait to add them until after the other ingredients like meat and cheese have been heated and put on your bread.
- If your choice of meat and cheese sound like they'd be good hot and melted, ***don't be afraid to heat up your sandwich!***
